        " and under Criterion C in the area of Engineering. Because it has achieved significance within the past fifty years, Criteria Consideration\n",
        " G applies. Under Criterion A, Discovery is significant as the oldest of the three extant orbiter vehicles constructed for the Space Shuttle Program (SSP),\n",
        " the longest running American space program to date; she was the third of five orbiters built by NASA. Unlike the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs,\n",
        " the SSP’s emphasis was on cost effectiveness and reusability, and eventually the construction of a space station. Including her maiden\n",
        " voyage (launched August 30, 1984), Discovery flew to space thirty-nine times, more than any of the other four orbiters; she was also the first orbiter\n",
        " to fly twenty missions. She had the honor of being chosen as the Return to Flight vehicle after both the Challenger and Columbia accidents. Discovery was\n",
        " the first shuttle to fly with the redesigned SRBs, a result of the Challenger accident, and the first shuttle to fly with the Phase II and Block I SSME.\n",
        " Discovery also carried the Hubble Space Telescope to orbit and performed two of the five servicing missions to the observatory. She flew the first and last\n",
        " dedicated Department of Defense (DoD) missions, as well as the first unclassified defense-related mission. In addition, Discovery was vital to the construction\n",
        " of the International Space Station (ISS); she flew thirteen of the thirty-seven total missions flown to the station by a U.S. Space Shuttle. She was the first\n",
        " orbiter to dock to the ISS, and the first to perform an exchange of a resident crew. Under Criterion C, Discovery is significant as a feat of engineering.\n",
        " According to Wayne Hale, a flight director from Johnson Space Center, the Space Shuttle orbiter represents a “huge technological leap from expendable rockets\n",
        " and capsules to a reusable, winged, hypersonic, cargo-carrying spacecraft.” Although her base structure followed a conventional aircraft design, she used advanced\n",
        " materials that both minimized her weight for cargo-carrying purposes and featured low thermal expansion ratios, which provided a stable base for\n",
        " her Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials. The Space Shuttle orbiter also featured the first reusable TPS; all previous spaceflight vehicles had\n",
        " a single-use, ablative heat shield. Other notable engineering achievements of the orbiter included the first reusable orbital propulsion system,\n",
        " and the first two-fault-tolerant Integrated Avionics System. As Hale stated, the Space Shuttle remains “the largest, fastest, winged hypersonic\n",
        " aircraft in history,” having regularly flown at twenty-five times the speed of sound.\"\"\""
